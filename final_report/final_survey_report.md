# Final Report on Cryptocurrency Awareness and Attitudes Survey

## Introduction

This report synthesizes the findings from a comprehensive survey conducted to understand public awareness, familiarity, ownership, attitudes, and future intentions regarding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The survey was conducted among 178 respondents from the United States, with data collection occurring in late December 2022. The survey aimed to capture a snapshot of the general population's perceptions and behaviors related to cryptocurrencies amidst a turbulent period for the industry.

## Survey Objectives

The survey focused on the following key areas:
- Awareness and familiarity with cryptocurrencies
- Current and past ownership of cryptocurrencies
- Attitudes towards cryptocurrencies
- Likelihood of purchasing cryptocurrencies in the future

## Methodology

An 18-question survey was distributed randomly to members of a QuestionPro Audience panel from December 22 - December 28, 2022. Survey respondents were from the United States. A total of 178 completed surveys were collected. Data was weighted by gender due to oversampling of females (69%). The data were processed and analyzed using SPSS.

**Note on Statistical Tests:** Chi-square tests were used to examine associations between categorical variables. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates a statistically significant association, meaning the observed relationship is unlikely due to chance.

## Key Trends and Patterns

### Awareness and Familiarity
- A significant majority (83.6%) of respondents had heard or read about cryptocurrencies, indicating high general awareness.
- Familiarity levels varied: 30.3% reported being not at all familiar, while 25.3% were very or extremely familiar.
- Education level was significantly associated with awareness and familiarity (Chi-square = 13.46, p = 0.036), with those having higher education (university undergraduate and postgraduate) more likely to have heard of and be familiar with cryptocurrencies.
- Income level also correlated with awareness and familiarity (Chi-square = 16.13, p = 0.024 for awareness; Chi-square = 52.29, p = 0.004 for familiarity), with higher income groups showing greater familiarity.
- Gender differences were observed in familiarity levels (Chi-square = 19.32, p = 0.013), with males generally reporting higher familiarity than females.

### Ownership and Experience
- Most respondents (63.3%) had never owned cryptocurrency.
- 20.3% currently owned cryptocurrency, and 16.4% had owned it previously but no longer did.
- Ownership was significantly related to education (Chi-square = 23.90, p = 0.021), gender (Chi-square = 9.68, p = 0.046), and income (Chi-square = 24.82, p = 0.036).
- Higher education and income groups were more likely to own cryptocurrencies. Males were more likely to own cryptocurrencies than females.

### Attitudes Towards Cryptocurrencies
- Opinions were mixed: 41.8% were neutral, 14.7% very favorable, and 12.4% very unfavorable.
- Males and higher income respondents tended to have more favorable opinions (Chi-square = 19.06, p = 0.040 for gender; Chi-square = 54.10, p = 0.021 for income).
- Education level did not show a statistically significant association with overall opinion (Chi-square = 40.03, p = 0.104).

### Future Purchase Intentions
- 30.3% were very unlikely to purchase cryptocurrencies in the future, while 30.3% were likely or very likely combined.
- Higher education and income groups were more inclined to consider purchasing (Chi-square = 40.65, p = 0.018 for education; Chi-square = 41.63, p = 0.047 for income).
- Gender differences in purchase likelihood were not statistically significant (Chi-square = 12.52, p = 0.129).

### Computer Skills
- Most respondents rated their computer skills as moderate to excellent.
- No significant associations were found between computer skills and cryptocurrency awareness, ownership, or attitudes, indicating computer skills may not be a major factor in engagement.

## Notable and Unexpected Findings

- Despite high awareness, a large portion of respondents remain unfamiliar or only slightly familiar with cryptocurrencies, indicating a gap between awareness and understanding.
- A substantial number of respondents (63.3%) have never owned cryptocurrency, suggesting barriers to entry or skepticism.
- Gender disparities were evident across multiple dimensions, including familiarity, ownership, and attitudes, highlighting potential areas for targeted education or outreach.
- Income level consistently influenced awareness, familiarity, ownership, attitudes, and future intentions, underscoring economic factors in cryptocurrency engagement.

## Differences Across Demographic Groups

- **Education:** Higher education correlates with greater awareness, familiarity, ownership, and likelihood to purchase.
- **Gender:** Males tend to be more familiar, more likely to own, and hold more favorable opinions about cryptocurrencies.
- **Income:** Higher income respondents show greater engagement and more positive attitudes.
- **Age:** No significant associations were found between age and cryptocurrency variables based on chi-square tests.

## Potential Implications

- Educational initiatives could focus on increasing familiarity and understanding among less educated and lower-income groups.
- Addressing gender disparities may help broaden the user base and promote inclusivity in the cryptocurrency space.
- The mixed attitudes and high neutrality suggest that public opinion is still forming, and market developments or regulatory changes could significantly influence future perceptions.
- The relatively low likelihood of future purchases among many respondents indicates potential challenges for market growth.

## Gaps and Areas for Further Investigation

- The survey did not deeply explore reasons behind ownership or non-ownership, which could provide insights into barriers.
- More detailed analysis of age-related trends could be valuable.
- Understanding the impact of recent market events on attitudes and intentions would be beneficial.
- Qualitative data from focus groups or interviews could complement these findings.

## Initial Recommendations

- Develop targeted educational campaigns to improve cryptocurrency literacy, especially among lower education and income groups.
- Create outreach programs aimed at increasing female participation and addressing gender gaps.
- Monitor changes in public opinion closely to adapt strategies in response to market and regulatory developments.
- Conduct follow-up research to explore motivations and barriers to ownership and investment.
