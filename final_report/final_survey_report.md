# Cryptocurrency Insights Survey: Synthesis Report

## Introduction

In the wake of significant events in the cryptocurrency industry during 2022—including the collapse of Terra Luna and the FTX exchange—this survey was conducted to gauge public awareness, attitudes, and behaviors regarding cryptocurrencies. The survey, distributed to a random sample of 178 U.S. residents, aimed to provide insights into the general population’s familiarity with, ownership of, and opinions about cryptocurrencies, as well as their likelihood to engage with these assets in the future.

## Survey Objectives

The survey was designed to address the following key objectives:
- Assess awareness and familiarity with cryptocurrencies
- Determine current and past ownership of cryptocurrencies
- Explore reasons for owning or not owning cryptocurrencies
- Understand attitudes toward cryptocurrencies
- Evaluate the likelihood of future cryptocurrency purchases

## Key Trends and Patterns

### Awareness and Familiarity
- **High Awareness:** 83.6% of respondents had heard of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- **Familiarity Levels:**
    - Not at all familiar: 30.3%
    - Slightly familiar: 28.7%
    - Moderately familiar: 15.7%
    - Very familiar: 10.7%
    - Extremely familiar: 14.6%

### Ownership and Intentions
- **Ownership:** 20.3% currently own cryptocurrency, while 16.4% have owned it in the past but no longer do. The majority (63.3%) have never owned cryptocurrency.
- **Future Intentions:** 30.3% are very unlikely to purchase cryptocurrency in the future, 14.0% are unlikely, 25.3% are neutral, 16.9% are likely, and 13.5% are very likely to do so.

### Attitudes
- **Neutrality Dominates:** 41.8% expressed a neutral opinion toward cryptocurrencies. Favorable (10.7%) and very favorable (14.7%) opinions were less common, as were unfavorable (10.2%) and very unfavorable (12.4%) views.

### Demographics
- **Gender:** 65.7% female, 33.1% male, 1.1% other.
- **Age:** Respondents were distributed across age groups, with the largest segments being 35-44 (20.8%) and 25-34 (19.7%).
- **Education:** Nearly half (49.4%) had a high school education, with 20.8% holding a bachelor’s degree.
- **Income:** 57.3% reported annual household incomes under $40,000.
- **Computer Skills:** 41.6% rated their skills as moderate, 24.7% as very good, and 21.3% as excellent.

## Insights and Correlations

### Computer Skills and Crypto Engagement
- **Statistically Significant Correlations:**
    - Respondents with excellent or very good computer skills were much more likely to be extremely or very familiar with cryptocurrencies (41.7% of those with excellent/very good skills vs. 4.7% of those with poor/very poor skills; p < 0.001).
    - Ownership rates were also higher among those with excellent/very good computer skills (30.0%) compared to those with moderate (10.8%) or poor/very poor skills (0%).
    - Respondents with higher computer skills were more likely to have heard of cryptocurrencies (97.8% of excellent/very good vs. 50% of poor/very poor; p = 0.0005), to own them, and to have favorable or very favorable opinions (22.2% of excellent/very good vs. 5.9% of poor/very poor; p < 0.001).
    - Those with excellent or very good computer skills were also more likely to consider purchasing cryptocurrency in the future (22.2% very likely vs. 0% for poor/very poor; p < 0.001).

### Gender Differences
- **Familiarity and Opinion:**
    - Males were more likely to be extremely or very familiar with cryptocurrencies (33.9% of males vs. 20.5% of females; p = 0.0053).
    - Males also showed a higher proportion of very favorable opinions (25.4% of males vs. 8.5% of females; p = 0.0174).
    - Ownership rates were higher among males (28.8%) than females (16.2%; p = 0.02).

### Age and Future Intentions
- **Likelihood to Purchase:**
    - Younger respondents (18-34) were more likely to express interest in purchasing cryptocurrency in the future (21.7% very likely for 18-34 vs. 2.2% for 55+; p = 0.0311).

### Income and Ownership
- **Ownership and Intentions:**
    - Higher income groups ($120,000+) were more likely to currently own cryptocurrency (39.1%) and to consider purchasing in the future (30.4% very likely), compared to lower income groups (p = 0.031 for ownership; p = 0.0235 for future purchase likelihood).

## Notable Trends and Unexpected Findings
- **Neutrality and Skepticism:** Despite high awareness, a large segment remains neutral or skeptical about cryptocurrencies, with a substantial portion unlikely to purchase in the future.
- **Education Data Gaps:** No valid crosstab data was available for education status, indicating a gap in the analysis.
- **Gender Imbalance and Demographic Skew:** The sample was predominantly female (65.7%) and lower-income (57.3% under $40,000), which may bias the results and limit the generalizability of findings to the broader U.S. population. The lack of education crosstab data further restricts the ability to assess the impact of education on crypto engagement.

## Implications
- **Digital Literacy as a Barrier:** Lower computer skills are associated with lower awareness, familiarity, and ownership. For example, 41.6% rated their computer skills as moderate, and these respondents were significantly less likely to own or be familiar with cryptocurrencies than those with excellent or very good skills. This suggests that digital literacy is a key barrier to broader adoption.
- **Targeted Outreach:** Younger (18-34), higher-income ($120,000+), and more digitally skilled individuals (excellent/very good computer skills) are more receptive to cryptocurrencies, as shown by higher ownership and purchase intention rates. Outreach and education efforts may be most effective when targeted at these groups.
- **Persistent Skepticism:** The prevalence of neutral (41.8%) and unfavorable (22.6%) opinions, even among those aware of cryptocurrencies, suggests that trust and perceived value remain significant hurdles.

## Gaps and Areas for Further Investigation
- **Education Impact:** The lack of valid crosstab data for education status limits understanding of how education influences crypto engagement.
- **Demographic Skew:** The overrepresentation of females and lower-income respondents may bias the results. Future research should aim for a more balanced sample to improve generalizability.
- **Qualitative Insights:** Further qualitative research (e.g., focus groups or interviews) could help explain the reasons behind neutrality or skepticism.
- **Longitudinal Trends:** Tracking changes over time would provide insight into whether attitudes and behaviors shift as the industry evolves.

## Initial Recommendations
1. **Enhance Digital Literacy:** Develop targeted digital literacy programs focusing on practical skills such as using digital wallets, understanding online security, and navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. Prioritize older adults and lower-income populations, who are less likely to have high computer skills.
2. **Address Trust Issues:** Initiatives to increase transparency and security in the crypto industry may help shift neutral or unfavorable opinions. This could include public education on how to identify scams, as well as industry-led efforts to improve consumer protections.
3. **Targeted Communication:** Focus outreach on younger, higher-income, and digitally skilled demographics, while also addressing the specific concerns of less engaged groups (e.g., those with moderate or poor computer skills).
4. **Further Research:** Conduct additional studies to explore the impact of education and to gather qualitative data on attitudes and barriers. Future surveys should strive for a more demographically balanced sample.

## Conclusion

The survey reveals a population that is largely aware of cryptocurrencies but remains cautious or neutral in their attitudes and intentions. Digital literacy, gender, age, and income all play significant roles in shaping engagement with cryptocurrencies. Addressing barriers related to skills and trust, and tailoring outreach to receptive demographics, will be key to fostering broader adoption and more informed public discourse around cryptocurrencies.
