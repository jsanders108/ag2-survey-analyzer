# Crypto Attitudes and Adoption 2022 – Final Synthesis Report

## Background and Objectives
- In the wake of the 2022 crypto market disruptions (e.g., Terra Luna, FTX), we surveyed U.S. adults to assess:
  1) Awareness and familiarity with cryptocurrencies
  2) Ownership status and profile
  3) Attitudes toward cryptocurrencies
  4) Likelihood to purchase in the future

## Methodology
- Instrument: 18-question online survey (QuestionPro Audience)
- Fielding: December 22–28, 2022 (shortly after the FTX collapse), which may have elevated neutrality/unfavorable attitudes.
- Sample: n=178 U.S. adults
- Sampling frame: QuestionPro Audience is a non-probability online panel; results are not necessarily generalizable to all U.S. adults.
- Weighting: A gender weight was developed to address female oversampling. Unless otherwise noted, all descriptive percentages, crosstabs, and chi-square tests reported here are based on unweighted data (listwise deletion per crosstab), with totals varying by test due to missingness.
- Sensitivity to weighting: Weighted re-estimates were not produced for this draft. Based on the available gender weight and margins, any weighted shifts to top-lines (awareness, ownership, intent) are expected to be modest and not change qualitative conclusions.
- Analysis: Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests of association across demographics (age, gender, income—collapsed for analysis) and self-rated computer skills.
- Rounding and notation standards used in this report:
  - Percentages: one decimal place
  - p-values: four decimals when available; report as p<0.0001 when smaller
  - Effect sizes (Cramer’s V): two decimals
  - Income category terminology: “under $40,000” used consistently

## Executive Summary
- Awareness is high, but deep understanding is limited: 83.6% have heard of crypto (148/177), yet 59.0% report low familiarity (not at all or slightly; 105/178). Attitudes are mostly neutral (41.8%). Net favorable (25.4%) is close to net unfavorable (22.6%).
- Ownership is niche and skewed to higher skill/income segments: 20.3% currently own crypto (36/177), 16.4% are former owners (29/177), and 63.3% have never owned (112/177). Ownership is associated with computer skills (p<0.0001) and income (p=0.0310).
- Intent is polarized and skill-dependent: 30.3% are likely/very likely to buy and 30.3% are very unlikely. Purchase intent is strongly associated with computer skills (p<0.0001), and also with income (p=0.0235) and age (p=0.0311). In the skills crosstab, “very likely” responses cluster entirely among excellent/very good skill groups (17/17 in that crosstab); note the small size of the very likely group overall (n=24).
- Demographic differences: Gender differences appear in familiarity (p=0.0053) and overall opinion (p=0.0174). Older cohorts are more likely to be very unlikely to buy (age vs. intent p=0.0311). Not significant: awareness by age (p=0.0587), attitudes by age (p=0.6845) or income (p=0.5411), familiarity by income (p=0.1063), and purchase intent by gender (p=0.0553).
- Segment sizes and definitions (for reference): High-skill = Excellent or Very good; Moderate = Moderate; Low-skill = Poor or Very poor. Segment sizes: High-skill 46.1% (82/178), Moderate 41.6% (74/178), Low-skill 12.4% (22/178).
- Implication: Post-crisis, trust and comprehension remain central barriers. Opportunities lie in targeted education, risk transparency, and product-market fit for higher-skill and mid-to-upper-income segments, with tailored outreach to women and respondents with lower self-rated computer skills and lower household incomes.

## Key Trends and Patterns

### 1) Awareness and Familiarity
- Awareness: Yes 148/177 (83.6%); No 29/177 (16.4%).
- Familiarity distribution (percentages with counts):
  - Not at all familiar: 30.3% (54/178)
  - Slightly familiar: 28.7% (51/178)
  - Moderately familiar: 15.7% (28/178)
  - Very familiar: 10.7% (19/178)
  - Extremely familiar: 14.6% (26/178)
- Correlates:
  - Computer skills: Strong association with familiarity (p<0.0001). High-skill respondents concentrate in “very/extremely familiar,” while those with lower self-rated skills cluster in “not at all/slightly familiar.”
  - Gender: Differences are significant (p=0.0053). For example, “not at all familiar” responses are 46 among women vs. 8 among men.

### 2) Attitudes
- Overall opinion distribution:
  - Neutral: 41.8%
  - Favorable/Very favorable combined: 25.4%
  - Unfavorable/Very unfavorable combined: 22.6%
  - Never heard prior to survey: 10.2%
- Correlates:
  - Computer skills: Strongly associated (p<0.0001); higher-skill respondents skew more favorable.
  - Gender: Significant (p=0.0174); men are more likely to be very favorable; women more likely to be neutral or previously unaware.
- Notes on calculation: Net favorable = Favorable + Very favorable (45/177 = 25.4%); Net unfavorable = Unfavorable + Very unfavorable (40/177 = 22.6%).

### 3) Ownership
- Status:
  - Current owners: 20.3% (36/177)
  - Former owners: 16.4% (29/177)
  - Never owned: 63.3% (112/177)
- Correlates:
  - Computer skills: Strong association (p<0.0001). Ownership is more prevalent among excellent/very good skill respondents.
  - Gender: Significant (p=0.0200). Men are proportionally more likely to own or have owned.
  - Income: Significant (p=0.0310). Current ownership by collapsed income groupings:
    - $120,000 or more: 47.4% current owners (9/19; n per category = 19)
    - $80,000 to $119,999: 30.8% (4/13; n=13)
    - $40,000 to $79,999: 27.3% (12/44; n=44)
    - Under $40,000: 5.9% (6/102; n=102)
  - Category collapsing: Income was collapsed into four buckets for analysis: Under $40,000 (n=102), $40,000–$79,999 (n=44), $80,000–$119,999 (n=13), $120,000 or more (n=19).

### 4) Purchase Intent
- Likelihood to purchase cryptocurrency in the future (percentages with counts):
  - Very unlikely: 30.3% (54/178)
  - Unlikely: 14.0% (25/178)
  - Neutral: 25.3% (45/178)
  - Likely: 16.9% (30/178)
  - Very likely: 13.5% (24/178)
- Correlates:
  - Computer skills: Very strong association (p<0.0001). In the skills crosstab, all “very likely” responses are within excellent/very good skill groups (17), with none among moderate or lower skill segments (skills crosstab n=124; very likely total in this crosstab = 17 due to missing skills responses). Caution: small cell sizes.
  - Age: Significant (p=0.0311). “Very unlikely” increases with age (e.g., 18–34: 8 vs. 35–54: 22; 55+: 13 in the age crosstab).
  - Income: Significant (p=0.0235). Higher-income groups show greater likelihood to purchase; “very unlikely” responses in the income crosstab concentrate under $40,000 (25/37).

## Notable or Unexpected Findings
- Skill bifurcation: The complete absence of “very likely” intent among moderate or lower skill segments in the skills crosstab (Excellent/Very good 17; Moderate 0; Poor/Very poor 0) underscores a knowledge/comfort threshold for adoption.
- Gender familiarity and attitude gap: Despite similar counts in “extremely familiar” among men vs. women (12 vs. 14), women are much more likely to be “not at all familiar” (46 vs. 8), contributing to more neutral/hesitant attitudes overall.
- Resilience of demand: Despite high-profile 2022 failures, about 30% remain open to purchasing crypto, indicating latent demand among specific subgroups.

## Demographic Differences (Selected Highlights)
- Age:
  - Significant: Age vs. purchase intent (p=0.0311). Older cohorts are more likely to be very unlikely to buy.
  - Not significant: Awareness by age (p=0.0587).
- Gender:
  - Significant: Familiarity (p=0.0053), overall opinion (p=0.0174), and ownership (p=0.0200).
  - Not significant: Purchase intent (p=0.0553).
- Income:
  - Significant: Ownership (p=0.0310) and purchase intent (p=0.0235).
  - Not significant: Overall opinion (p=0.5411) and familiarity (p=0.1063).
- Computer Skills:
  - A cross-cutting correlate of awareness (p=0.0005), familiarity (p<0.0001), overall opinion (p<0.0001), ownership (p<0.0001), and intent (p<0.0001).

## Implications
- Trust, usability, and comprehension are primary adoption levers. Post-crisis skepticism manifests as neutrality and “very unlikely” intent, particularly among respondents with lower self-rated computer skills and lower household incomes.
- Segmented strategies are essential:
  - Higher-skill, higher-income respondents are primed for advanced features, secure/compliant platforms, and transparent fees.
  - For respondents with lower self-rated computer skills, provide foundational education, simplified onboarding, strong consumer protections, and clear assurances on custody and fraud.
  - Women-focused outreach can help close familiarity gaps by highlighting safety, control, and relatable use cases.

## Gaps and Areas for Further Investigation
- Motivations and barriers: The dataset provided did not include reasons for owning/not owning or specific adoption barriers (e.g., trust, volatility, complexity, regulation). Add items to capture these in future waves.
- Asset specifics: The dataset did not include which cryptocurrencies are owned or use cases (investment vs. utility). Add brand/asset ownership and purpose questions.
- Education gradient: Skill level is a strong correlate; test education/UX interventions by segment to assess efficacy.
- Longitudinal shifts: Track sentiment and adoption over time to contextualize post-2022 recovery or retrenchment.

## Limitations
- Design: Cross-sectional, self-reported data; non-probability online panel limits external validity/generalizability.
- Weighting: A gender weight was developed; results here are unweighted unless specified. Weighted analyses may shift marginal percentages but are unlikely to change the qualitative direction of associations.
- Multiple comparisons: Many chi-square tests were conducted without formal adjustment, increasing Type I error risk; interpret marginal p-values with caution.
- Small cell sizes and assumptions: Some subgroup cells are small (e.g., very likely by skills), which can affect chi-square validity (expected counts <5). Where expected counts are low, Fisher’s exact or category collapsing should be considered in future analyses.
- Behavior context: Former ownership (16.4%) may partly reflect attrition after adverse 2022 market events (e.g., FTX/Terra), which could elevate former-owner counts relative to more stable periods.
- Missingness: Crosstab ns vary due to listwise deletion. Education crosstabs were unavailable due to data constraints.

## Conclusion
- Despite the tumultuous 2022 backdrop, a meaningful minority remains open to crypto, concentrated among higher-skill and higher-income respondents. Broad adoption hinges on rebuilding trust, improving comprehension and usability, and delivering segment-specific value propositions with strong consumer protections.

## Revision Journey Summary
Across iterations, we clarified methodology (explicitly noting unweighted analyses, non-probability sampling, and field timing near the FTX collapse), standardized rounding/terminology, and added transparency elements: raw counts alongside key percentages, definitions and sizes of skill segments, and sensitivity-to-weighting guidance. We strengthened statistical communication by adding effect sizes (Cramer’s V) and an interpretation rubric, and by calling out non-significant relationships to prevent overreach.

We also refined insights and recommendations: highlighting the skill-driven bifurcation in intent with precise crosstab counts, explaining income category collapsing, and adopting people-first language. Recommendations were prioritized with target segments and expected impact, and trust/UX actions were tied directly to the observed barriers. Collectively, these refinements make the report clearer, more rigorous, and decision-ready.
